# GINA's Alaskan jump start for QGIS 

A small project to help jump start an Alaskan's QGIS experience.  

Goal: Help an Alaskan new to QGIS and Web Services get up and going with public web map resources ready to go in a QGIS project file.

Here you will find a QGIS project that launches with an Alaskan Albers Equal Area EPSG:3338 projection and a set of public web services to act as orintation and basemap layers.  

_This project is not meant to act as a HOWTO for QGIS or GINA web services._
